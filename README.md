Texual Form Tutorial:
1: Go onto the blockers chrome-extension:// find them above.
2: Bookmark the extension page (bookmark A) if you wish. Then, bookmark chrome://kill (B) and chrome://hang (C).
3: While on the extension page (A), click the chrome://kill bookmark (B). The page should crash. You should already have the next step prepared.
4: Instantly start spamming chrome://hang (bookmark C) and quickly reload the page while spamming (ideally with the refresh key on your keyboard or ctrl+R). You should have reloaded within one or two seconds of killing the page.
5: If the extension page (bookmark A) no longer loads, then LTMEAT worked!

go to https://cros.tech/
and find your board and download the 114 version (if there is no option for 114 then your screwed)
most chromebooks will let you downgrade to 114 on 115
balenaEtcer to a usb
and recover down to 114 

if you are on v117 - you can only downgrade to v117
if you are on v116-v112 - you can only downgrade to v112
(unless on edge case board)
DONT ASK ABOUT THESE THINGS
Forced Updates
Not having a 114 image on cros.tech (try and find one)
On version 116+
No skidding



Open chrome://extensions in a new tab. Keep this page open.
Go to the settings page for the extension you want to disable.











On this page, click the "freeze extension" button.
Back on the chrome://extensions page, spam the "allow access to file URLs" switch for a few seconds.
The extension should now be temporarily disabled. For this effect to persist, flip the "allow access to file URLs" again every few minutes, or if pages start getting blocked again.
You may also need to reopen this page every once in a while to prevent an unavoidable memory leak from crashing the system.

5: when you get there you can then go to the Sign In button and add a home account....
6: when your done using your home account be sure to wipe the memory and cookies, etc. because they can still see it.
If you dont wipe your history the school has a chance to figure out what computer use or did what.
For example if my computer mac number was 90:CC:DF:68:8D:5A schools will be able to trace your computer throught the child protection app they have on your chomputers
